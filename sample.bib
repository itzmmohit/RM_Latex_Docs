abstract = {Computational intelligence is employed to solve factual and complicated global problems, though neural networks (NNs) and evolutionary computing have also affected these issues. Biometric traits are applicable for detecting crime in security systems because they offer attractive features such as stability and uniqueness. Although various methods have been proposed for this objective, feature shortcomings such as computational complexity, long run times, and high memory consumption remain. The current study proposes a novel human iris recognition approach based on a multi-layer perceptron NN and particle swarm optimisation (PSO) algorithms to train the network in order to increase generalisation performance. A combination of these algorithms was used as a classifier. A pre-processing step was performed on the iris images to improve the results and two-dimensional gabor kernel feature extraction was applied. The data was normalised, trained, and tested using the proposed method. A PSO algorithm was applied to train the NN for data classification. The experimental results show that the proposed method performs better than many other well-known techniques. The benchmark Chinese Academy of Science and Institute of Automation (CASIA)-iris V3 and Center for Machine Learning and Intelligent Systems at the University of California, Irvine (UCI) machine learning repository datasets were used for testing and comparison.},

abstract = {An empirical investigation of active/continuous authentication for smartphones is presented by exploiting users' unique application usage data, i.e., distinct patterns of use, modeled by a Markovian process. Specifically, variations of hidden Markov models (HMMs) are evaluated for continuous user verification, and challenges due to the sparsity of session-wise data, an explosion of states, and handling unforeseen events in the test data are tackled. Unlike traditional approaches, the proposed formulation utilizes the complete app-usage information to achieve low latency. Through experimentation, empirical assessment of the impact of unforeseen events, i.e., unknown applications and unforeseen observations, on user verification is done via a modified edit-distance algorithm for sequence matching. It is found that for enhanced verification performance, unforeseen events should be considered. For validation, extensive experiments on two distinct datasets, namely, UMDAA-02 and Securacy, are performed. Using the marginally smoothed HMM a low equal error rate (EER) of 16.16% is reached for the Securacy dataset and the same method is found to be able to detect an intrusion within ~2.5 min of application use.},
